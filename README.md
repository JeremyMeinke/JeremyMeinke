- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is @JeremyMeinke, a Physics PhD Candidate at Arizona State University! I am set to graduate in early 2023. Most of my graduate work involves private repos for my own version control, but I will include a public repository highlighting useful code and resources used data analysis of sub-mm astronomy data (future link will be here).
- ðŸ“« Questions? See my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-meinke
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Physics, Astronomy, Data Science, and various methods of analyzing the universe.  I also enjoy watching and analyzing sports (football, basketball), video games, baking, and reading.
