- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is @JeremyMeinke, a Physics PhD Candidate at Arizona State University! I am set to graduate in early 2023. 
- Most of my graduate GitHub work involves private repos for my own version control, but I will include a public repository highlighting useful code and resources used for my data analysis of mm astronomy data (future repo link will be here). See my recent data analysis work shown in (under review) and https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01245 for details.  

- ðŸ”­ I also design & simulate planar superconducting antennas using HFSS for mm-detectors, and design cryogenic (RF) readout chains (for mechanical, thermal, and electrical considerations).

- ðŸ“« Questions? See my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-meinke
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Physics, Astronomy, Data Science, and various methods of analyzing the universe.  I also enjoy watching and analyzing sports (football, basketball), video games, baking, and reading.
